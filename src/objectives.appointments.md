# objectives for booking appointments

## TO BE DONE

5. Lab Reports Feature:
   We haven't implemented the functionality for users to access their lab reports.

6. General Inquiry Handling:
   The general inquiry option hasn't been fully developed yet.

7. Error Handling and Recovery:
   We need more robust error handling throughout the chat flow, including options for users to correct mistakes or go back to previous steps.

8. Accessibility Features:
   We haven't explicitly addressed accessibility concerns to ensure the chat interface is usable by people with disabilities.

9. Analytics and Logging:
   We haven't implemented detailed logging or analytics to track user interactions and improve the system over time.

10. Integration with Hospital Systems:
    The chat likely needs to integrate with other hospital systems for appointment scheduling, doctor availability, etc.

Would you like to focus on implementing any of these features next?

## DONE

2. when they click on book appointment, send a message like "what can we help you with" and enable the input form
3. whatever they type will be sent to gpt and the departments will be found and will be shown as buttons
4. the user can click on which department theyd like to book an appointment for, and that will be shown as a message
5. User Details Collection:
   After selecting a department, we need to collect the user's personal information (name, email, phone number, date of birth).
